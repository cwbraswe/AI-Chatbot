Usage
The chatbot application is designed to provide answers to a wide variety of questions based on the knowledge it has acquired from its training data. Here are some examples of how to interact with the chatbot:

User: What is the capital of France?
Chatbot: The capital of France is Paris.

User: Who painted the Mona Lisa?
Chatbot: The Mona Lisa was painted by Leonardo da Vinci.

User: How far is the moon from the Earth?

Feel free to ask the chatbot any question or prompt, and it will do its best to provide you with an accurate and informative response.

Limitations
While the chatbot is designed to answer general knowledge questions, it's important to note that it has some limitations:

The chatbot's responses are generated based on patterns and information present in its training data. It may not have access to the most up-to-date information or be aware of recent events.

The chatbot relies on the accuracy of its training data. If the training data contains inaccuracies or biases, it may influence the chatbot's responses.

The chatbot may not always understand ambiguous or vague questions. It performs best when provided with clear and specific questions or prompts.

The chatbot's responses should be evaluated critically. While it strives to provide accurate information, it may occasionally generate incorrect or misleading responses.

Conclusion
The chatbot application integrated with OpenAI provides a powerful tool for obtaining answers to a wide range of general knowledge questions. By leveraging the capabilities of OpenAI's language model, the chatbot aims to assist users in finding the information they need. However, it's important to be aware of the limitations mentioned above when using the chatbot.
